# A Season in the Sun: Packers’ Performance Through the Years  

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes the Green Bay Packers' performance over the past seven NFL seasons, examining season-by-season trends in offensive and defensive efficiency. Using game-level statistics, we investigate key performance metrics to identify patterns, strengths, and areas for improvement.  

## Research Question  
How does the Packers’ performance vary by season, and what trends are observable over time?  

## Motivation  
Football teams experience performance fluctuations due to factors like roster changes, injuries, and coaching strategies. This study aims to:  
- **Track offensive trends** (e.g., points scored, passing/rushing efficiency).  
- **Assess defensive consistency** (e.g., points allowed, sacks).  
- **Analyze correlations** between time of possession and overall success.  

By evaluating these metrics, we can gain deeper insights into the Packers’ long-term strategies and their effectiveness.

### Data Description
The dataset includes game-level statistics for 117 Packers games from the regular seasons of the past seven NFL seasons, sourced from Pro-Football-Reference.com. Postseason games are not included in this dataset, ensuring that only regular season performance is analyzed. The data captures a wide range of offensive, defensive, and special teams metrics, as well as the game outcomes. Key variables include passing (e.g., passing_y/a), rushing (e.g., rush_y/a), and overall game performance (e.g., total_points, opp_points, possession_time). Data was originally collected by NFL statisticians during each game and made publicly available through Pro Football Reference.

## Hypotheses  
1. **Offensive performance trends over time:**  
   - Total points scored, passing yards, and rushing yards will show consistent trends or fluctuations.  
2. **Defensive performance variability:**  
   - Opponent points allowed and sacks will exhibit greater season-to-season variations.  
3. **Impact of possession time:**  
   - Longer possession time will correlate with higher points scored and better overall performance.
